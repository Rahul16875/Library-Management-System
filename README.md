C++ Library Management System

C++ Library Management System
Private

Write a complete C++ console-based Library Management System that includes the following features:

🔹 Object-Oriented Design:

Use classes such as Book, User, and Admin

Apply inheritance: Admin should inherit from User

Implement encapsulation, constructor overloading, and function overloading if relevant

Use polymorphism where appropriate (e.g., virtual display function)

🔹 Functional Requirements:

Add, view, update, and delete books

Search books by title, author, or ISBN

Issue and return books (track issued status)

Maintain a list of users/members

Admin login with username/password (simple hardcoded login is fine)

🔹 Data Structures & STL:

Use std::vector to store books and users

Use std::map or std::unordered_map for fast lookups by book ID

Use file handling (fstream) to persist books and user data across sessions

Load data from files on program start and save on exit

🔹 File I/O:

Save and load data (books and users) using text or binary files

Handle empty files or missing data gracefully

🔹 UI & Error Handling:

Build a menu-driven interface in the terminal for admin and user roles

Validate user input properly (e.g., invalid IDs or options)

Use try-catch blocks for basic exception handling

I'll create a complete C++ Library Management System with all the features you requested. This will be a comprehensive console-based application with object-oriented design, file handling, and proper error management.


This comprehensive Library Management System includes all the features you requested:

🔹 Object-Oriented Design Features:
Classes: Book, User, Admin, and LibrarySystem
Inheritance: Admin inherits from User
Encapsulation: Private data members with public getter/setter methods
Constructor Overloading: Multiple constructors for Book class
Function Overloading: Multiple addBook() and searchBooks() methods
Polymorphism: Virtual display() functions with different implementations
🔹 Functional Requirements:
✅ Add, view, update, and delete books
✅ Search books by title, author, or ISBN
✅ Issue and return books with status tracking
✅ User/member management
✅ Admin login system (default: username="admin", password="admin123")
🔹 Data Structures & STL:
✅ std::vector for storing books and users
✅ std::unordered_map for fast book ID lookups
✅ std::map for user ID mappings
✅ File handling with fstream for data persistence
🔹 File I/O:
✅ Automatic save/load on program start/exit
✅ Graceful handling of missing files
✅ Text-based file format for easy debugging
🔹 UI & Error Handling:
✅ Menu-driven terminal interface
✅ Input validation with retry mechanisms
✅ Try-catch blocks for exception handling
✅ Separate admin and user interfaces
🔹 Key Features:
Default Admin Account: username="admin", password="admin123"
Data Persistence: All data saved to books.txt and users.txt
Smart ID Management: Auto-incrementing IDs with collision prevention
Comprehensive Search: Search by title, author, or ISBN
Book Status Tracking: Track which books are issued to which users
Memory Management: Proper cleanup with destructors
Polymorphic Display: Different display formats for users and admins
To compile and run:

g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o library_system
./library_system
The system will create data files automatically and provide a full-featured library management experience!

✅ Delete books from the system
✅ Search books by title, author, or ISBN
✅ Track book availability status
👥 User Management
✅ Add regular users and administrators

🏗️ Technical Architecture
Object-Oriented Design
Inheritance: Admin class inherits from User class
Encapsulation: Private data members with controlled access
Polymorphism: Virtual functions for different display behaviors
Constructor Overloading: Multiple ways to create objects
Function Overloading: Multiple versions of key functions
Data Structures Used
std::vector<Book> - Dynamic array for book storage
std::vector<User*> - Dynamic array for user storage
std::unordered_map<int, int> - Fast O(1) book ID lookups
std::map<int, int> - Ordered user ID mappings
Error Handling
Try-catch blocks for exception safety
Input validation with retry mechanisms
Graceful handling of file I/O errors
Memory leak prevention with proper destructors
🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
C++ compiler with C++11 support (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
Standard Template Library (STL)
Compilation
Using GCC/Clang:
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o library_system
Using MSVC (Visual Studio):
cl /EHsc main.cpp
Running the Application
./library_system
📋 Usage Guide
First Time Setup
Run the application
The system creates a default admin account:
Username: admin
Password: admin123
Admin Functions
Login: Use admin credentials to access administrative features
Book Management: Add, update, delete, and search books
User Management: Add new users and administrators
Library Operations: Issue and return books
View Reports: See all books and users in the system
Public Functions
View available books
Search books by title, author, or ISBN
